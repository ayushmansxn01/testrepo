''WELCOME'' to social network analysis with R and statnet!  On this page, you will find all the information you need to prepare for this year's Sunbelt workshops. Please check this site periodically for updates and announcements.  If you have additional questions, please email us at [mailto:statnet_help@u.washington.edu statnet_help].

The sections below cover the following topics:

* [[#WorkshopSessions|List of workshops]]
* [[#AnnouncementsandUpdates|Announcements and Updates]]
* [[#Prerequisites|Recommended prerequisites for each workshop]]
* [[#WorkshopMaterials|Workshop materials]] (tutorials and slides) for download and printing (NB:  we will not distribute hardcopy handouts at the workshops)
* [[Installation|Instructions for downloading and installing R and statnet]] (NB: you should do this before the workshop)


== Workshop Sessions ==

This year we are offering eight workshops.  They are loosely organized into two sequences (Introduction to network modeling in statnet, and Dynamic network modeling in statnet), with some additional advanced topics:

-------

== Announcements and Updates ==

* For the workshops, you will need the latest versions of the statnet packages from CRAN. 
  * If you have not installed statnet before, please see the [[Installation]] instruction page.  
  * If you have installed statnet packages before, you should either perform a fresh install or update.
  * Make sure you have the package(s) needed for your workshop (these are listed in the [[#WorkshopMaterials|Workshop materials]] below)

* The statnet workshops are designed as hands-on labs, and are best experienced interactively using your own laptop and software installation. If you would like to simply listen and try out the exercises later, that is fine too -- however, we do ask that attendees who plan on using their laptops during the workshop install the required software before the workshop begins. 

* Some workshops may also require supplemental data files, which are included in the [[#WorkshopMaterials|Workshop materials]] below (and should be downloaded prior to the workshop).

* Workshop slides and handouts will be posted here before the workshop; downloading and printing is optional, but may make it easier to follow along on your own.

* Workshop participants with problems or questions regarding software installation prior to the workshop should email [mailto:sjenness@uw.edu Sam Jenness] or [mailto:emilyjs@uci.edu Emma Smith] for Mac-related questions, [mailto:cbengibson@gmail.com Ben Gibson] for Windows, and [mailto:yuey6@uci.edu Yue Yu] for Linux.

== Workshop Materials ==

Workshop materials will be posted here as they are completed, for the convenience of session attendees. 
  * ''Packages required'' lists the statnet packages you'll need
  * ''Electronic Handouts'' contain the tutorial for the workshop.  It's handy to have an electronic copy of this during the workshop to cut and paste commands into R as we go along.
  * ''Slides'', if present contain supplemental learning materials.
  * ''Data Files'', if present are the supplemental data files needed for a workshop.  

Attendees should download all the files needed for their respective workshop sessions and save them in a convenient spot. This section will be updated regularly.
