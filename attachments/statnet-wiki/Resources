There are extensive help facilities available for statnet, both through the help function of the program (which is the standard R-based help function) and on this website. Technical support is also available via email though the statnet help mailing list (see the [wiki:FrequentlyAskedQuestions#HowdoIjointhestatnetusersgroup statnet Users Group section] of the FAQ for more information).

== statnet User's Guide: JoSS papers on statnet ==

The following links take you to papers from the ''Journal of Statistical Software'' (JoSS).  JoSS devoted a  [http://www.jstatsoft.org/v24/ special volume] to statnet in 2008 (volume 24) covering all of the packages in the suite available at the time, and the team continues to use JoSS as the primary outlet for publicizing additions to statnet suite.  These papers provide a comprehensive overview of statnet functionality, as well as hands-on tutorials for each of the packages.

== Training Workshop Materials ==

The team teaches workshops on statnet in various settings. The main venue is the annual ''INSNA Sunbelt Social Network Conference'', where we now teach a set of 6 workshops that range from an introduction to social network analysis with R and Statnet, to programming your own ergm model terms. 

* The materials from the most recent Sunbelt workshops can be found on the [wiki:Sunbelt2016] page.
* The materials from the 1st annual EUSN can be found on the [wiki:EUSN2014] page.

We also teach workshops on Epidemic Modeling with the **EpiModel** and **statnet** packages.

* The materials for the most recent Network Modeling for Epidemics workshop can be found on the [wiki:NME2014] page.
