== Announcements and Updates ==

* For the workshops, you will need the latest versions of the statnet packages from CRAN. 
  * If you have not installed statnet before, please see the [[Installation]] instruction page.  
  * If you have installed statnet packages before, you should either perform a fresh install or update.
  * Make sure you have the package(s) needed for your workshop (these are listed in the [[#WorkshopMaterials|Workshop materials]] below)

* The statnet workshops are designed as hands-on labs, and are best experienced interactively using your own laptop and software installation. If you would like to simply listen and try out the exercises later, that is fine too -- however, we do ask that attendees who plan on using their laptops during the workshop install the required software before the workshop begins. 

* Some workshops may also require supplemental data files, which are included in the [[#WorkshopMaterials|Workshop materials]] below (and should be downloaded prior to the workshop).

* Workshop slides and handouts will be posted here before the workshop; downloading and printing is optional, but may make it easier to follow along on your own.

* Workshop participants with problems or questions regarding software installation prior to the workshop should email [mailto:sjenness@uw.edu Sam Jenness] for Mac-related questions, [mailto:cbengibson@gmail.com Ben Gibson] for Windows, and [mailto:yuey6@uci.edu Yue Yu] for Linux.

=== Introduction to Social Network Analysis with R and statnet ===

Session Time: Tuesday April 5th, 8:00am – 11:00am

Workshop Length: 1 session (3 hours)

Attendance Limit: N/A

Instructors: Ryan M. Acton (Data Scientist, !WeddingWire Inc.), racton@weddingwire.com
Lorien Jasny (Lecturer, University of Exeter, United Kingdom), L.Jasny@exeter.ac.uk

This workshop session will serve as a basic introduction to the importation, manipulation, and descriptive analysis of
social network data within the R/statnet platform. Topics covered will include: an overview of basic R functions and data
types; importation of network data into R; network data manipulation; management of metadata for complex networks;
visualization of network data; calculation of network descriptives (e.g., centrality scores, graph-level indices); and use of
classical network analytic techniques (e.g., blockmodeling). No prior experience with R or statnet is assumed, but
attendees should have familiarity with the basic concepts of descriptive network analysis. (Participation in this workshop
session is recommended prior to the other statnet sessions.)

=== Moving beyond Descriptives: Basic Network Statistics with R and statnet ===

Session Time: Tuesday April 5th, 11:30am – 2:30pm

Workshop Length: 1 session (3 hours)

Attendance Limit: N/A

Instructors: Lorien Jasny (University of Exeter, United Kingdom), L.Jasny@exeter.ac.uk

This workshop session will serve as an introduction to the use of basic statistical methods for network analysis within
the R/statnet platform. The approach taken is practical rather than theoretical, with emphasis on simple, robust
methods for hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis of single and multi-network data sets. Topics will include: 
tests for marginal relationships between node or graph-level indices and covariates; Monte Carlo tests for structural
biases; network correlation, autocorrelation, and regression; and exploratory multivariate analysis of multi-network data
sets. We will also cover interpreting R code in existing functions and writing your own functions. Attendees are expected
to have had some prior exposure to R, but extensive experience is not assumed. Completion of the “Introduction to
Network Analysis with R and statnet” workshop session is suggested (but not required) as preparation for this session.
Familiarity with the basic concepts of descriptive network analysis (e.g., centrality scores, network visualization) is
strongly recommended. To get the most out of the workshop, participants are recommended to bring a laptop with R,
RStudio, and statnet installed. Sample data and code will be provided by the organizer.

Note: This workshop is the 2nd in the statnet series of workshops. Participants may want to take the Intro to social network analysis with R and statnet before this workshop.

=== Exponential Family Random Graph Modeling (ERGMs) Using statnet ===

Session Time: Tuesday April 5th, 3:00pm-6:00pm

Workshop Length: 1 session (3 hours)

Attendance Limit: N/A

Instructors:Martina Morris, morrism@u.washington.edu
Carter T. Butts, buttsc@uci.edu

Prerequisites:
Familiarity with R. Previous experience with the statnet packages network and sna is helpful but not required.

Synopsis:
This workshop will provide an introductory tutorial on using exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) for
statistical modeling of social networks, using a hands-on approach to fitting these models to data. The ERGM framework
allows for the specification, estimation, and simulation of models that incorporate the complex dependencies within
networks, and provides a general and flexible means of representing them. The session will demonstrate ERG modeling
using the statnet software in R.

Topics covered within this session include: an overview of the ERGM framework; defining and fitting models to empirical
data; interpretation of model coefficients; goodness-of-fit and model adequacy checking; simulation of networks using
ERG models; degeneracy assessment and avoidance; and modeling and simulation of complete networks from
egocentrically sampled data. Familiarity with basic descriptive network concepts and statistical methods for network
analysis within the R/statnet platform is recommended. Attendees are expected to have had some prior exposure to R,
but extensive experience is not assumed.

=== Introduction to Modeling Temporal (Dynamic) ERGMs Using statnet ===

Session Time: Tuesday April 5th
, 11:30am – 2:30pm

Workshop Length: 1 session (3 hours)

Attendance Limit: N/A

Instructors:Martina Morris, morrism@u.washington.edu
Steven Goodreau, goodreau@uw.edu

Prerequisites:
Familiarity with R. Previous experience with the statnet packages (ergm, network, sna).

Synopsis:
This workshop will provide an introduction to the estimation and simulation of dynamic networks using Temporal
Exponential-Family Random Graph Models (TERGMs) in statnet. We will cover the statistical theory and methods for
separable temporal ERG modeling, with a hands-on tutorial using the TERGM software package. TERGM can be used for
both estimation from and simulation of dynamic network data, and it provides a wide range of fitting diagnostics.
The topics covered will include estimation from network panel data, from a single cross-sectional network with link
duration information, and from cross-sectional, egocentrically sampled network data. Simulating dynamic networks with
both fixed and changing node sets will also be covered. We will demonstrate how the results of a dynamic network
simulation can be visualized an animated “network movie” using the ndTV package in statnet. An example of the type of
"network movie" these tools can produce can be found at statnet.org/movies. This workshop will assume familiarity
with R, and the network, SNA and ergm packages in statnet. The "Exponential Family Random Graph Modeling (ERGMs)
with statnet" workshop is recommended as preparation.

=== Modeling Relational Event Dynamics with statnet ===

Session Time: Tuesday April 5th, 3:00pm –6:00pm

Workshop Length: 1 session (3 hours)

Attendance Limit: N/A

Instructors: Carter T. Butts, buttsc@uci.edu
Christopher S. Marcum, christopher.steven.marcum@gmail.com

Prerequisites:
Some experience R and familiarity with descriptive network concepts and statistical methods for network analysis in the
R/statnet platform is expected.

Synopsis:
This workshop session will provide an introduction to the analysis of relational event data (i.e., actions, interactions, or
other events involving multiple actors that occur over time) within R/statnet platform. We will begin by reviewing the
basics of relational event modeling, with an emphasis on models with piecewise constant hazards. We will then discuss
estimation of dyadic and more general relational event models using the relevant package, with an emphasis on handson
applications of the methods and interpretation of results. Using the informR package, we will then show how to
construct models for spell data, and data involving multiple event types. Attendees are expected to have had some prior
exposure to R and statnet, and completion of the "Introduction to Network Analysis with R and statnet" workshop
session is suggested (but not required) as preparation for this session. Familiarity with parametric statistical methods is
strongly recommended, and some knowledge of hazard or survival analysis will be helpful.

=== Managing Dynamic Network Data in statnet: Animations, Data Structures and Temporal SNA ===

Session Time: Tuesday April 5th, 3:00pm – 6:00pm

Workshop Length: 1 session (3 hours)

Attendance Limit: N/A

Instructors: Skye Bender-deMoll, skyebend@skyeome.net, Steve Goodreau

Prerequisites:
Familiarity with R. Previous experience with the statnet packages (ergm, tergm, network and networkDynamic) is helpful
but not required.

Synopsis:
This workshop will provide an introduction to the R packages networkDynamic, ndtv and tsna. These tools can be used
for both empirical and simulated network data. We will illustrate both, with some well-known data sets from the social
network literature, and some simulations from the statnet package tergm. The workshop will demonstrate how to
import, transform and extract relational data with timing information from various data structures (matrices, spell lists,
toggles, etc.). We will discuss advantages of various temporal models and representations (continuous vs discrete time,
etc.) as well as considerations about how to slice and aggregate time in networks.

Attendees will learn to create visualizations of network dynamics, including exporting network animations as videos or
interactive HTML5 web pages. We will explain how to attach and manipulate dynamic vertex and edge attributes and
effectively use a range of graphical properties to represent them (color, shape, size, transparency, speed, and
annotation). We will also discuss some common visualization challenges, such as adjustments needed when working
with networks with disconnected components, and how to determine if a network has appropriate size and density to
create an animation. Some non-animation techniques such as relationship timelines, filmstrips and other projections will
be explained as well. Finally we will demonstrate some of the basic functionality for calculating temporal network
statistics using the tsna package, including computing temporal paths, and basic sequence measures.

=== Introduction to Egocentric Network Data Analysis with ERGMs and TERGMs using statnet ===

Session Time: Tuesday April 5th
, 6:30pm-9:30pm

Workshop Length: 1 session (3 hours)

Attendance Limit: N/A

Instructors:Pavel Krivitsky, pavel@uow.edu.au
Martina Morris, morrism@uwashington.edu

Prerequisites:
Some experience R and familiarity with descriptive network concepts and statistical methods for network analysis in the
R/statnet platform (especially ERGM and TERGM) is required.

Synopsis:
This workshop will provide an introductory tutorial on analyzing egocentrically sampled data with exponential-family
random graph models (ERGMs) for statistical modeling of social networks. It will be a hands-on workshop demonstrating
how to fit, diagnose and simulate both static and dynamic ERG models from such data. We will be using the new
“ergm.ego” package, part of the integrated statnet software in R.

Topics covered within this session include: a review of different approaches to analyzing egocentrically sampled data in
the social network community, an overview of the basic statistical concepts that govern methods for analyzing sampled
network data, and the exponential family theory that supports the use of ERGMs for egocentric samples; defining and
fitting ERGMs to egocentric data; interpretation of model coefficients; goodness-of-fit and model adequacy checking;
and simulation of complete networks from the specified ERG models. With one additional piece of data – information on
relational duration – these methods can be generalized to dynamic network analysis. The workshop therefore will also
cover estimating, fitting, diagnosing and simulating dynamic networks from cross-sectional egocentrically sampled data.
The ergm.ego package provides users with simple access to many functions that support these analyses.

=== Valued Network Modeling with statnet

Session Time: Wednesday April 6th, 8:00am – 11:00am

Workshop Length: 1 session (3 hours)

Attendance Limit: N/A

Instructors:Pavel Krivitsky, pavel@uow.edu.au
Carter T. Butts, buttsc@uci.edu

Prerequisites:
Attendees are expected to have had some prior exposure to R, but extensive experience is not assumed. Familiarity with
binary ERG modeling with the R/statnet platform (e.g., from the “Exponential Family Random Graph (ERGM) Modeling
with statnet” workshop session) is assumed.

Synopsis:
This workshop session provides a tutorial using statnet software particularly ergm and latentnet to model social
networks whose ties have weights (e.g., counts of interactions) or are ranks (i.e., each actor ranks the others according
to some criterion), using latent space models and exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) generalized to
valued ties, and emphasizing a hands-on approach to fitting these models to empirical data.

The ERGM framework allows for the parametrization, fitting, and simulation from models that incorporate the complex
dependencies within relational data structures, and provides an extremely general and flexible means of representing
them, while latent space models postulate an unobserved social space in which actors are embedded, facilitating
principled visualization and group detection. Topics covered within this session include: importing, modifying, and
exporting edge values on network objects; an overview of the valued ERGM framework and the notion of reference
distribution; an overview of latent space models for social networks; defining and fitting models to empirical data,
including ERGM terms meaningful for counts and ranks; interpretation of model coefficients; simulation of networks
using these models; and ERGM degeneracy assessment.
