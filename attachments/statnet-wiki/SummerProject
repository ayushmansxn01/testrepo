== Summer 2014 Research Project / Training Workshop ==

We are soliciting applications for an unpaid internship in statistical research and computing for Summer 2014. 
The project description and requirements are listed below.  To apply, please use the UW Catalyst form here

** Project Description **

The goal of this project is to implement a prototype for a web-based GUI for network analysis and visualization, by integrating leading-edge software for user interfaces (Shiny) and social network analysis (statnet).  The interface should provide seamless and intuitive access to R functionality within a web browser.  This removes the need for a user to learn how to operate R via a command line interface, but should not provide a barrier to learning those commands if desired.

We anticipate the project will take about 40 hours, during the month of July 2014.

On completion of the project, students are expected to 

* know how to manipulate and visualize social network data
* develop R-Shiny UIs

See info below for details on R, shiny, and statnet.

This project will focus on the package "ndtv", which allows users to create dynamic network movies from temporal network data:
