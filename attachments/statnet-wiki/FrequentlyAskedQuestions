1. How can I interpret the coefficients for a gw* term (gwdegree, gw*sp)?

There are two papers that provide the technical details:

* Hunter and Handcock, JCGS 2006 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/106186006X133069?journalCode=ucgs20
* Hunter, Social Networks 2007 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2031865/

Some other less technical resources on how to think about interpreting the coefficients:

* Notes on interpretation [[attachment:gwtermsNotes.txt]]
* Excel worksheet for gwdegree (referenced in the notes above) [[attachment:GWDegree.xlsx]]
* Examples illustrating gwesp [[attachment:gwespInterpretation.pdf]]
