=== Location of Workshop ===

[[http://goo.gl/maps/xFjJr|Waterfront Activity Center]] (WAC) Meeting room, 3400 Montlake Blvd NE, Main campus of the University of Washington in Seattle. The WAC is a beautiful building overlook Union Bay on Lake Washington.  However, it is currently hidden behind a sea of construction, and thus can be tricky to find.

On Saturday, the workshop will take place at [http://goo.gl/maps/53E9B Denny Hall], 401, at 10am.

'''From !McMahon''': The WAC is a pleasant [[http://goo.gl/maps/n2Jpk|15-20 minute walk]]  across the east side of campus. 

'''By bus''':  The two closest bus stops, with their walking routes to the WAC, are [[http://goo.gl/maps/BFZNM | here]].  Bus stop “A” is served by routes 25, 43, 44, 48, and many regional expresses.  Bus stop “C” is served by routes 25, 31, 32, 65, 67, 68, 75, and many regional expresses.  The WAC is labeled “B”. You can use [[http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/transit/ | Google Transit]], [[http://pugetsound.onebusaway.org/ | OneBusAway]], or your conference organizers as sources of information on which of these buses serve your accommodations.

'''From U District Hotels''': you can choose to walk across campus (a little over a mile; see the !McMahon and bus maps above for guidance on walking routes once you get to campus), or take one of many buses to either of the stops shown above and walk the remainder (see bus maps above).

'''Parking''': Parking is available directly in front of the WAC for $15 per day.  Enter the area through the large construction site on the east side of Montlake Blvd, just north of the Montlake Bridge. Please park in front of the building and come see us or the building manager; we will provide you a code to put in the machine to obtain the $15 rate.  Parking is also available for $6 per day in the [[http://www.washington.edu/maps/?e1 | E-1 lot]], a [[http://goo.gl/maps/qGYji | 10-minute walk from the WAC]].  This lot requires that you pay in cash to a gate arm that does not make change.


=== On-campus accommodations ===

[[http://goo.gl/maps/KMzPJ|McMahon Hall]], Main campus of the University of Washington in Seattle.

=== Ground transportation from Sea-Tac airport to University District / !McMahon Hall ===

Directions below will bring you to the university in general or to !McMahon Hall. If staying off-campus, please determine the exact location of your accommodations in relation to the university.

'''Google Maps directions''' from Sea-Tac airport: [[http://goo.gl/maps/TAs3b|Directions]], and walking to !McMahon Hall: [[http://goo.gl/maps/ucR2x|Directions]]

'''Public transit''': follow signs to Link Light Rail, pay for a ticket to Westlake Station in Downtown Seattle ($2.75). Board the train (which only goes in one direction).  Exit at Westlake, the last stop.  Board either bus 71, 72 or 73 to the UW, and pay $2.25 (if traveling on weekend or non-rush hour) or $3.00 (if traveling during rush hour). Cash required; make sure to take a transfer from the driver. Exit the bus at NE Campus Parkway, on the UW campus. If going to !McMahon Hall, you can choose either to walk across campus (about ¾ mile, 12-15 mins), or switch to another bus for the last stretch.  If the latter, simply move forward to Bay 2, and await any of the following buses: 25, 65, 67, 68, 75, or 372. Show the driver your transfer, and take the bus through campus to the last campus stop, at NE Stevens Way and Pend Oreille Road NE.  !McMahon Hall is the tall gray building in front of you behind the trees.

'''Taxi''': follow signs to cabs. Fare to the UW will be approximately $60 with tip.

'''Rental car''': upon leaving the airport car rental facility, follow signs for Interstate 5 (I-5) northbound toward Seattle and Vancouver, BC. Stay on I-5 through downtown Seattle and continue north to exit !#169 (NE 45th Street).  Turn right to go eastbound on NE 45th Street. Do note that on-campus parking costs $15 per day, and that Seattle has an extensive bus system that reaches all of the tourist sites within the city, so that most visitors will not find a car necessary.
