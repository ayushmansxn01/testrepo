== EXERCISE 2: Thinking conceptually about concurrency at the population level (Introduction) ==


Now imagine a whole group of people – let’s say there are 24 of them.  And exactly 1 of them is infected with an STI – Person 7.  We will color Person 7 red, and everyone else blue.  And we will consider two scenarios, and two questions with each scenario.

'''Scenario 1''': In this scenario, everyone begins with 1 partner, with whom they stay sexually active for 3 months.

After that time, they all end their existing partnerships, and start a new 3-month relationship, as follows:

'''Scenario 2''': In this scenario, everyone has two partnerships concurrently, in a single giant circle, which they maintain for 3 months:

After this, everyone spends the next 3 months with no partners at all.

=== Questions ===

1. Over time, how many partners did each person have in Scenario 1?
2. Over time, how many partners did each person have in Scenario 2?
3. Over time, how many people (including Person 7) could possibly get infected in Scenario 1?
4. Over time, how many people (including Person 7) could possibly get infected in Scenario 2?
