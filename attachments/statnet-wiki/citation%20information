A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

{{{
@Manual{handcock:statnet,
title = {statnet: Software tools for the Statistical Modeling of Network Data},
author = {Mark S. Handcock and David R. Hunter and Carter T. Butts and Steven M. Goodreau and Martina Morris},
year = {2003},
address = {Seattle, WA},
url = {http://statnetproject.org}
}
}}}

== Citing the component packages of statnet (e.g., ergm) ==

To cite the individual packages (e.g., ergm, network, sna, degreenet, latentnet, networksis) please use the information given by their individual citation function calls. For example:

{{{
citation(package="ergm")
}}}

Most packages have additional published materials that review their specific functionality. These can help give readers a sense of the applications for which package was developed. The best cites are below.
