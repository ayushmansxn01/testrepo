= Outline of Topics to be Discussed and Next Developer Mtg =
Hopefully we will have enough folks at Sunbelt 2015?

== ergm's term locating functionality may need to be redesigned to comply with CRAN #1134 #1162 ==

ergm finds terms by querying the search path for functions named {InitErgm.*}.  If a package is loaded via namespace and not attached (the new CRAN way) it breaks.  We need to design a new way for this to work.

== transitioning stuff to github (and/or transitioning to git) ==

(skye) I think that transitioning our internal source code management from svn to git would be a great thing to do. 
  * for basic tasks, git commands only slightly different than svn
    * does separate concept of 'commit' (cache the state of the code into your local branch) from 'push' (update the main branch to the state of your local branch).  I find that this is actually an improvement in workflow
  * would allow us to push/pull changes from public repositories like github
    * Svn model is around granting full access to repository, github allows people to clone copies of a repository in such a way that it is really easy to to propose a 'pull request'  (a patch that can incorporate multiple commits and comments).  Maintainers can easily review and cherry pick changes for main repository 
  * git it is the current standard. it what people learn now days, and what we should teach students

We could also move our development process (ticketing, bug reports, notifications, etc) to github, but that is actually a seperate question.  And if we are using the git protocol,  we can easily pull in updates to our internal repository submitted to github mirrors of our repository.  

== summary.stergm is very slow for large graphs (summary.ergm is the culprit) #1061 ==
== what package should contain network-related stuff that computes statistics of general utility but do not belong in 'sna' package (or 'network' because it not data structure stuff) ==

We do have some functions (some hidden in ergm) that may be of general utility, should we have a new package i.e. networkSna for these? Or a better mechanism for contributing to sna package?
== passing dynamic attributes into tergm ==

people have asked for it, shouldn't be hard to impelement

== representing dynamic missingness ==

we need a standard for this
