<p>We envision different kinds of analyses that could be done with the WHAMP model related to ADAP and/or PrEP-DAP. We would like your thoughts on the kinds of analyses that would be of greatest interest to you and the kinds of outputs / projections that would be most useful in informing your work.</p>
<div id="evaluating-impact-of-program-changes" class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluating impact of program changes</h2>
<p><strong>1. What are the kinds of ADAP and/or PrEP-DAP changes/scenarios that you would like to evaluate using the WHAMP model?</strong></p>
<p>Examples of external changes (not under DOH control):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Elimination of drug subsidies</p></li>
<li><p>Changes in the cost of drugs, care, or insurance premium costs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of programmatic changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Changing program eligibility, such as increasing or decreasing income elgibility thresholds for ADAP</p></li>
<li><p>Imposing an income threshold on PrEP-DAP</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. For external changes in particular, how would the program respond to budget reductions?</strong></p>
<p>Your input is needed to appropriately implement these scenarios in the model (and capture how reduced spending would impact HIV outcomes).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize existing clients and limit new enrollment to stay within budget</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize enrollment by income level (would current clients ever be disenrolled?)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. For each scenario, we will project expected epidemiological outcomes (incidence, prevalence, total infections over a specified time horizon). Are there other outcomes of interest?</strong></p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ADAP and/or PrEP-DAP program size over time</p></li>
<li><p>ADAP and/or PrEP-DAP expenditures over time</p></li>
<li><p>ART and/or PrEP coverage</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="projections-of-the-current-programs" class="section level2">
<h2>Projections of the current programs</h2>
<p><strong>1. The model can also be used to project outcomes into the future (under current programs/policies). Are there specific outcomes that would be of interest to DOH?</strong></p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HIV prevalence and incidence over time, with a particular focus on “end the epidemic” targets</p></li>
<li><p>ADAP and/or PrEP-DAP program size or expenditures over time</p></li>
<li><p>Estimation of infections averted by ADAP and/or PrEP-DAP over a defined time horizon (we would model the counterfactual where these programs do not exist at all)</p></li>
</ul>
